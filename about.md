Phylogenetics and phylodynamics are central topics in modern biology. Phylogenetic inferences reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between organisms, whereas phylodynamic inferences reveal the dynamics that lead to the observed relationships. These two fields have many practical applications in disciplines such as epidemiology, developmental biology, paleontology, ecology and even linguistics. However phylogenetics and phylodynamics are complex and fast-evolving fields. As such, inference tools are not easily accessible to researchers who are not from a computational background.


BEAST 2 is a cross-platform program for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of molecular sequences. It estimates rooted, time-measured phylogenies using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology. BEAST 2 uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to average over tree space, so that each tree is weighted proportional to its posterior probability. BEAST 2 includes a graphical user-interface for setting up standard analyses and a suit of programs for analysing the results.

BEAST 2 is a complex program and with the resources available on the internet it is challenging to learn BEAST without the help of an expert. 
Workshops, summer schools and lectures can only reach a handful of the people interested in performing BEAST analyses. 
The **Taming the BEAST** website will provide a platform that collects all tutorials for [BEAST 2]("http://beast2.org") (and perhaps BEAST 1 as well) in one central repository. 
In this way a set of well-curated and up-to-date tutorials will be available for the community at large.
