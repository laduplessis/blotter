# Summary

BEAST is a complex program and with the resources available on the internet it is challenging to learn BEAST without the help of an expert. 
Workshops, summer schools and lectures can only reach a handful of the people interested in performing BEAST analyses. 
The **Taming the BEAST** website will provide a platform that collects all tutorials for BEAST 2 (and perhaps BEAST 1 as well) in one central repository. 
In this way a set of well-curated and up-to-date tutorials will be available for the community at large. 


A core aspect of the site is that it should be straightforward to add or edit tutorials and that anyone should be able to contribute. For this reason the tutorials, and the website, are hosted on GitHub. Each tutorial is a different GitHub repository. The website is hosted on its own organization page. Although tutorials are ideally hosted as repositories on the website organization page, they can be hosted anywhere on GitHub. The website simply acts as an aggregator for tutorials.




# Website style and layout

Based on Trevor Bedford's lab website [bedford.io](http://bedford.io). I haven't changed much so far, besides text and logos. It can (and probably) should be changed. 
A lot of the things are great and should be left alone (font and KaTeX for equations are both beautiful). Some other things I think should probably have a high priority: 

- I don't like Trevor's navigation bar. It is overly complicated (it takes a lot of code to make a collapsible navbar that can't be collapsed). 
- The website needs a footer.
